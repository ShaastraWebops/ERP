this is a very informal mail
few ideas i have
some ideas may be impossible , some may be possible ,just wanted to right them out

combine ideas form gmail(bussiness) and facebook(social networking)
1)fun element in erp is must
*profile pic
*status
*each dept will have a shout box
-----shout box is that u just shout something and everyone reads it 
*user adding his fav links(fun and informational too)
*etc(you think)

2)it must be simple
*proper documentation of how things work
*if possible a small tutorial
*each dept will have their own special features
*the threads(discussions) like in google must be simple (not too flashy ) and well deferentiated from the background color(here gmails is better than fbs)
*remembr the above point . it is main
*the shaastra website must be accessible from here
*event coord and handle his page(tough i know)

3)things which i feel is tough but will add on a lot
*search
*sms(mobops teams headache)
*any person can see any others page(LET QMS DO ANYTHING WE WILL FIGHT FOR TRANPERANCY).oobba he cant edit
*integrating mobile games(its a event of shaastra so it must not be that tough i guess)
*something dynamic must be there on the users page(like animation or some thing i dont know but this will add on)

4)some small things(writing it down so that i dont forget)
*their must be a emergency shut box which only cores can use
*if we can we can include google search(Google offers this and even agrees to pay per n=some number search , and i read that its not so difficult)

5)QMS
*they must be able to star tasks(like google bookmark, this will help us to decide whos page is best)

another reason why gmail and facebook is famous cause every users page is not same !!
may be we cant do something great but the above point is strong one and something on these lines is should be tried



we need not be too good cause insti junta will be using it(we must be decently good) and cause they will like it a bit more cause IT IS CREATED IN INSTI

6)tricks to make erp more successfull
*keep coupons for the best page or something such
*make erp available outside insti only for viewing so junta will wanna show off(you feel like writing lol i know :P)
*change the name (change it to SPAARK as u suggested) this reminds me of the dialouge--"Remove the from 'thefacebook')"
*this will be the place where shaastra's documentation will be done , so if we include some good features for documentation it linda becomes compulsory[we both know qms right :)]


next_stage(ERP)
{
    make the mail part working
    if done:
        then make coords assigning tasks
    then start a bit of fun part :
        status
        profile pic

    then any user viewing other users page
    """
    your suggestions (my brain is not working)

    """
    infinte testing required
    return next_stage2(ERP)
    
}

i want u to comment on each idea , let it be trivial_max but do comment

we have to ask cores to give us one frontend guy atleast
its tough without one
