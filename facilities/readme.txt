Note to the user.

On first glance, the facillities portal code looks to be jumbled up and garble. It doesn't look much better the 2nd time. Or the 3rd.
The initial layout of the portal was very different than what it is now. It was initially built on a more interactive basis, where event coordinators can request for items, and these get scrutinized, edited and approved by the Facilities and QMS heads. Due to lack of time, and general laziness, this was scrapped. The code was fully functional though, save a few minor glitches.

The code has not really been cleaned up, just in case some of the previous model can still be salvaged later.
Now, it runs on a near-fully automated level, requiring minimum number of inputs, and taking most of the data from the csv.

In hope that the code may live to see better days, I write this message.Re-write completely if possible
