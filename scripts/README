README for the Scripts:

From a clean start:
     First
     + create the database
     + Then run syncdb

Simply run :

do_it_all ()

to get everything done.

Else, run the Scripts in this order:

1.) create_groups()

2.) create_depts ()

3.) create_users ('users.txt')

4.) create_tasks (n = 5, partial_subtask = False)

This will create 5 Tasks for each Department's Core
One SubTask is for the Core's Department.
The other is for a random Department.


5.) create_tasks (n = 3, partial_subtask = True)

This will create 3 Tasks which have 2 SubTasks each assigned to. Mark
both SubTasks for other Departments (at random), but don't assign to
their Coords.

6.) finish_some_subtasks ()

Mark one complete SubTask in each Department as Done.
