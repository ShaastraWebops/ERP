Contributing to Django
======================

If you think working *with* Django is fun, wait until you start working *on*
it. We're passionate about helping Django users make the jump to contributing
members of the community, so there are several ways you can help Django's
development:

    * Blog about Django. We syndicate all the Django blogs we know about on
      the `community page`_; if you'd like to see your blog on that page you
      can `register it here`_.

    * :doc:`Report bugs and request features<bugs-and-features>` in our
      `ticket tracker`_.

    * Join the `django-developers`_ mailing list and share your ideas for how
      to improve Django. We're always open to suggestions.

    * :doc:`Submit patches<writing-code/submitting-patches>` for new and/or
      fixed behavior. If you're looking for an easy way to start contributing
      to Django have a look at the `easy pickings`_ tickets.

    * :doc:`Improve the documentation<writing-documentation>` or
      :doc:`write unit tests<writing-code/unit-tests>`.

    * :doc:`Triage tickets<triaging-tickets>` that have been created by other
      users.

... and many more ways! Really, **ANYONE** can do something to help make
Django better and greater. Browse the following sections to find out how:
